Ariadne feared for the life of Theseus, who she had fallen in love with, because
he was to enter the maze designed by Daedalus. She saved him by giving him
a ball of string.

Building experimental code for GQL_to_Cypher has proven to be as complex as
navigating Daedalus's maze. As it turns out, `make` does not
backward-chain pattern rules. Gradle/Groovy tends to build projects in
layers.

To use the Ariadne build tool, a developer writes their dependency graph in
Groovy, utilizing a map and a set of regular expression matching
functions. Then, to build or clean up the project, the developer invokes
Ariadne. 

Ariadne was originally written in Groovy because it evolved incrementally as
part of a Gradle script.
