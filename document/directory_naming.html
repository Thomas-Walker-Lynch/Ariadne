    <h2>Name origin and rationale</h2>

    <p>Typically, developers and project administrators do not employ a semantic
      system for naming directories, but more commonly use conventional
      placeholder names. The intended purpose of files in a directory with a
      placeholder name then must be inferred from experience or inspection of
      the files, or learned from other people or from documents.</p>

    <p>For example, a directory named 'exe/' probably derives its name from the
      fact that the contained files have their executable permission bit set;
      however, such a directory will not contain all such files.  There might
      even be some files in an `exe/` directory that do not have their
      executable permission bit set. The two concepts being an `exe/` file
      (i.e. being a file in an `exe/` directory) and being an executable file
      are not identical. The actual intended meaning of being an `exe/` file
      will sometimes be that the contained files are applications available to a
      user, or that they are tools available for use in a project.
    </p>

    <p>The directory names in this project resulted from an exploration of a
      property-based file system. In such a system a number of files and
      agents are defined. Then we can ask questions about their relationships.
      Files with a relationship to the developer are collected, and this
      becomes the `developer/` directory. In a similar manner we get the
      directories, `tester/', and `javac/`.  In this latter case the
      agent is a compiler rather than a role.
      </p>
      
    <p>However, when attempting applying this method in practice it became
      apparent that the recognition of relationships was insufficient.  Consider
      the directories `deprecated` and `scratch_pad`. There is no
      'Mr. Deprecated' or 'Mr. Scratch_Pad' who the contained files are
      for. (And this conclusion is not for the lack of trying. Even mythological
      beings did not suffice as agents.) Rather than saying a file has a
      relationship with an agent, these properties (directory names) are states
      imposed by decree by an agent on a file.  Perhaps the developer, has
      decreed that a file is now deprecated, or a build script has decreed that
      it is a scratch_pad file. Such decrees are typically more dynamic than the
      relationship properties. Also, these properties are disconnected from the
      contents of the file.  When, for example, we say a file is for the java
      compiler we can surmise something about its contents. However when we say
      a file is `deprecated` we can surmise nothing about its contents.
      </p>

    <p>To understand a directory name within this system, one can imagine
      reading said name as part of a sentence that integrates the
      property. Consider two property names: 'is-a' and 'is-for'. For example,
      "Each file in the <code>document/</code> directory is a document," or
      "Each file in the <code>developer/</code> directory is for the developer."
      Although the property name is not carried over to the conventional file
      system, we can typically infer what it must be. It is beyond the scope of
      discussion here, but in actuality, our collections are defined by
      predicates that are given a file's properties and relationships as
      arguments, where the predicate resolves to true if and only if the file
      belongs to the collection. Now wouldn't that be interesting if we
      instead derived a probability?
    </p>

    <p>It is uncommon for a property value to be plural. While it is not
      disallowed, it rarely occurs in practice. This is true independent of
      whether we are discussing a relationship property or a state
      property. Hence when we make a file collection based on a shared property,
      then carry that over as a directory name in a conventional file system,
      the resulting directory name will often be singular.  This pattern can be
      observed in the case of the `document/` directory, as shown in the prior
      paragraph.
