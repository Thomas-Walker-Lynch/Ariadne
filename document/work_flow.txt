Work Flow

1. Development

  1.1. developer makes edits
  1.2. developer uses 'release' which will copy relevant files to the $REPO_HOME/release_candidate
  1.3. tester will test the candidate

2. Release

  2.1. Upon completion of testing, project manager will make a new branch for release
     named release_<version>. Version has a major and minor number.

2.2. on the new branch the 'release_candidate' directory is renamed 'release_<version>'.

3. Release specific fixes

  3.1.the 'release_candidate' directory is recreated
  3.2 steps 1.1 - 1.33 are repeated
  3.3 when testing is complete, 'release_candidate' is renamed 'release_version' 
      with the minor version incremented.

4. Major release

  Development continues on the `core_developer_branch` even after creation of a
  `release_version` branch. For a next major release, increment the major release
  number and do as described in steps 2 then 3.
