1. extract TestBench as its own project. Perhaps it can replace paintit as the
project skeleton.

2. Make a project 'skeleton' for starting other projects out of this one. `PaintIt` was a
first draft at this, but made too early. Because this is java project I let
`release` and `jvm` go to the repo.  Executables in other projects will be platform
dependent, so if the directories are to be checked in, for example, `release` should
be moved to `release_<X>` and a new empty release directory should be made.  Here
<X> is the platform the executable can run on.
