Normally I would test individual subroutines/methods, then
combinations. However, this code was copied over from a Gradle script.  So
instead, the tests are graded in complexity.

test0 - tests that the code will compile. The test itself consists
of an empty graph. This was also the first test to make use of the
directory structure and work flow.

test1 - The test graph has a single symbolic node. The question is if
the build code will run. The build code prints a message, said to
be the title of the graph.

test2  - The test graph consists of a single node abstraction function
that builds nodes on the fly given a recognized target input.
