javac/TestBench does not belong here. It should have its own project.

Currently it must be made first using `make_TestBench`.  It will be made again,
redundantly as part of `make` because it is in the javac directory. This does
not hurt anything.

Later we will use an earlier version of the build tool to build the build tool,
and cases and `make_TestBench` can be handled more gracefully if it is still
here.
